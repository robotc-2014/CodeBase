CodeBase
========
This is the root of the repository. We will place all our directories and files in this repository.

Code will be placed in the 'src' folder. 

Each person has their own folder under the 'src' folder to upload their own code.

The 'Common' folder is where the team places code that has been determined to be useful for future use
